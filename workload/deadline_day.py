CymbalGoal Lab 3 (mkt015) — the deadline-day workload generator.

This catalogue has been measured extensively against live AlloyDB clusters
during lab development — the weights, worker counts and queries below are the
ones the shipped lab's figures were taken from. If you point it at your own
instance, expect the same shape of load and your own numbers.

WHAT IT IS FOR. Lab 3's story is an incident: transfer deadline day, load up,
response times creeping. That story needs a database that is actually under
load, and it needs the load to be legible from four different console surfaces —
Database Center, Query Insights, the Index Advisor, and Active Queries. Each of
those has to have something DIFFERENT to say, or the lab is one finding told
four times.

THE THREE DESIGN CONSTRAINTS, and they pull against each other:

  1. IT HAS TO RUN FROM CLOUD SHELL. There is no VM in this series. P-55
     measured the COPY path as client-CPU-bound, and Cloud Shell is the weak
     end of it. So this generator makes the SERVER work hard while the CLIENT
     does almost nothing: every statement returns an AGGREGATE, never rows.
     Reading 832,000 rows to return one number costs the client a single int.

  2. IT HAS TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE. Every statement carries a sqlcommenter comment
     naming the part of the app that issued it. That is what turns Task 2 from
     "this query is slow" into "the transfer ticker is slow", which is the
     sentence an on-call developer actually needs to say. It depends on
     preserve_comments and record_application_tags in the instance's
     observability config — see the Terraform.

  3. IT HAS TO BE HONEST. Every slow query here is slow because of a real gap
     in the shipped schema, not because it was written to be slow. The six
     baseline indexes serve the SEARCH application CymbalGoal used to be.
     Deadline day introduces access patterns nobody indexed for. That is a
     thing that happens to real systems, and it is why the Index Advisor is
     being asked a genuine question.

# The first cut anchored every date predicate on '2025-01-01', which is sixteen
# months back from the end of the data. "The last three days" was therefore a

# sitting after it — which is not what deadline day means, and it quietly made
# every window predicate match far more than intended.

# Anchor on the real end of the data instead. main() refreshes this from the
# database at startup so it cannot go stale if the corpus is ever regenerated.

# of these columns ever gets an index in setup/lab3-setup.py's BASELINE_INDEXES,
# the corresponding query stops being interesting and Task 3 loses a finding.

#
#     deadline-rollup  2,982.54 ms   (heavy lane)
#     scout-search       108.12 ms

#
# transfer-ticker was the single heaviest-weighted query in the mix and it
# costs 7.5 ms, because `transfers` is 11 MB and 65,494 rows — too small to
# hurt no matter how badly it is indexed. Nearly a third of the load was being
# spent on the cheapest statement in the catalogue.
#
# The weight now follows the cost. appearances (111 MB, 832,193 rows) is the
# only table in this corpus big enough to make a seq scan hurt, so the two
# queries that scan it carry the mix.
#
# ⚠️ transfer-ticker is NOT removed and its weight must not go to zero. It is
# still the query whose NAME tells the deadline-day story, and Task 2's lesson

    """A transfer completing. THE ONLY WRITE IN THIS WORKLOAD.

    🔴 ADDED 2026-08-21, and it exists to fix a measured gap rather than to add
    realism for its own sake.

    The first live run's wait-event breakdown was: CPU 2.36 s, IPC 0.21 s,
    IO 0 s, LWLock 0 s, Client 0, Internal 0. Every drop of it CPU and the
    parallel-query plumbing behind Gather. That is because the workload was
    ENTIRELY READ-ONLY, and a read-only workload against a fully cached corpus
    can never produce a lock wait or an I/O wait.

    Task 4's teaching payload is the difference between "this query was slow"
    and "this query was slow BECAUSE it was waiting on something". With only
    CPU and IPC in the picture there is no second half of that sentence, and
    Task 4 collapses into Task 2.

    So: deadline day gets its actual defining event. A player changes clubs.

    WHY AN UPDATE ON `players` SPECIFICALLY. It is the widest table in the
    corpus — ~17 KB a row, because of the 3072-dimension embedding — so every
    row update writes a large new tuple and real WAL. That is the cheapest
    honest way to put I/O and lock waits into a database that otherwise fits
    entirely in RAM.

    It is also true to the story, which matters more than it sounds: a lab that
    manufactures contention with pg_sleep or an advisory lock is teaching the
    student about the workload generator. This one is teaching them about
    deadline day.

    ⚠️ IT MUTATES THE CORPUS, deliberately and reversibly. Only
    `current_club_id` moves, and only ever to a club that already exists, so no
    foreign key is violated and no row count changes. A fresh load restores the
    original state. Nothing in the lab asserts a specific player's club.
